Project 3
Project Description: (Student)
You are required to design and implement a small student’s database. The system is supposed to
maintain a record of students enrolled at a college/university. Following information is stored for each 
student.
 student_id of type integer
 student_name of type string
 Date of birth of type Date (user defined data type)
 gender of type character
 semester of type integer
 department of type string
 gpa of type float.
 extra of enumerated data type extracurricular Skill
(Note: Extracurricular Skill can have the following possible values: Society Member, Sportsman,
InternetGeek and None.)
The program should enable its user to perform the following operations.
1. Assign memory for an initial list of five students. Initially, store data for ten students, using assignment 
statements.
2. Display the information of all the students on campus, in the tabular form.
3. Update the information of an old student (e.g., change his date of gpa, semester etc.)
4. Add the information for a new student. The program should be able to handle all the possibilities (i.e., 
insert at the start, end or anywhere).
5. Search and display the information of a particular student on campus. (The student information will be 
searched by giving the full student’s name. In case, no student with that name is found, an error message 
will be displayed on the screen.)
6. Search and display the information of all the students of a particular semester and a particular 
department, in the tabular form.
